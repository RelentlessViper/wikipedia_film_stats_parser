### Wikipedia film stats visualization tool

This tool is used to visualize various stats about films taken from [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films).

This project is focused on such aspects as:
- Scrapy for data parsing;
- SQLite for data storage;
- HTML, CSS, JS for chart visualization.

### Limitations
Unfortunately, due to inability to register in Heroku in Russian federation, the deployment in GitHub Pages was not successfull.

This is how the main page should look like:
